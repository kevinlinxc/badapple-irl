# Bad Apple

My takes on the quest to find creative ways to play the Bad Apple!! music video.

Currently just two attempts:
1. [Replacing the subframes of each frame with the closest frame from the original video](replace_subframes_with_frames/README.md)
2. [Making it irl with real apples](badapple-irl/README.md) (probably what you're here for)
