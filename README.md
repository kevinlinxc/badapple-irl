# Bad Apple

My takes on the quest to find creative ways to play the Bad Apple!! music video.

Currently just two attempts:
1. Replacing the subframes of each frame with the closest frame from the original vdeo
2. Making it irl with real apples

To run:

- Install Python
- python -m venv venv
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py
